# standard-drinks-calculator
A simple standard drinks calculator designed to minimise the amount of taps on a tablet needed to get desired results.

Ideal for a fast paced bartending environment where your finger and screen are both potentially a little wet.

Uses metric units, a definition of standard drink as 10 grams, and an ethanol density of 0.789 g/ml.
